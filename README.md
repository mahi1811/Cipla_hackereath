Cipla Data Scientist Hiring Challenge on Hackerearth (Machine Learning)
 
 The goal of this challange is to Predict Loan Sanction Amount (USD) by using Machine Learning Algorithms on Dataset having 23 features and 30000 Data points.
 First part of the model is preprocessing Data by converting categroical data to numerical data and to remove null values from training and test data and replacing them with Mean  or Median Value.
 Second part was building model and prediction
 Multiple models were tested during this challenge (Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting, SVR and Random Forest). Finally, the chosen model was Gradient Boosting Regression
